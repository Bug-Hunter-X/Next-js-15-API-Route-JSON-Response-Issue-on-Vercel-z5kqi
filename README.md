# Next.js 15 API Route JSON Response Issue on Vercel

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when deploying a Next.js 15 application to Vercel.  A seemingly simple API route, designed to return JSON data, fails to respond correctly in the production environment, while functioning as expected locally. The error is particularly frustrating due to the lack of a clear error message.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.  The API route should work correctly.
4. Deploy the application to Vercel (or similar platform).  The API route will fail to return the expected JSON.

## Expected Behavior

The API route should return a JSON object containing a message and a timestamp, regardless of the environment.

## Actual Behavior

The API route returns an error in the production environment on Vercel (or similar platform).  The exact error may vary, but it is related to an issue with the JSON response.

## Solution

The solution involves careful handling of potential errors during data fetching and response sending. The updated `api-route-solution.js` demonstrates robust error handling and explicit JSON response type specification.
